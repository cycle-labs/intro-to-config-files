Feature: Layered Data

In this example, we have a default.conf file which contains login credentials and 
test data for creating a new order in the grocer.io application. The default test
data includes an order number, a customer name, and a price in USD. We also have
ca.conf, euro.conf, and yuan.conf the include the data from default.conf but
overrides the price data in other currencies. The env.conf contains a setting which
controls which of these conf files are loaded, so which currency is used when
the test runs. It has a default value of euro.conf. If we ran the test as is,
the order would be created in euros.  There is also the ability to create a
local.conf file which includes env.conf and then overrides the envFile entry so 
that a different currency is used in the test. Alternatively, we can inject an
ENV_FILE environement variable to specify a different currency at run time, which
may be very useful if running the test in a pipeline. In that type of setup, we
could easily switch between currencies without having to change any of the files
in the project.

Background: Open browser and login
# load credentials, web locators, and env data
If I assign values from config file "layeringConfigData/local.conf" to variables
Elsif I assign values from config file "layeringConfigData/env.conf" to variables
EndIf
And I assign values from config file $envFile to variables

Given I open Chrome web browser
And I navigate to $grocer_url in web browser
# wait for the login screen to load
And I see element $loginPage_emailLabel in web browser within 10 seconds
When I type $username in element $loginPage_usernameField in web browser within 10 seconds
And I type $password in element $loginPage_passwordField in web browser within 10 seconds
And I click element $loginPage_loginButton in web browser
Then I do not see element $loginPage_loginButton in web browser within 10 seconds

After Scenario:
If I close web browser
EndIf

Scenario: Enter order
Given I see element $orderPage_title in web browser within 10 seconds
And I click element $orderPage_addOrderButton in web browser within 10 seconds
Once I see $addOrderModal_title in web browser

When I type $customer_name in element $addOrderModal_customerField in web browser within 10 seconds
And I type $order_number in element $addOrderModal_orderNumberField in web browser within 10 seconds
And I type $price in element $addOrderModal_priceField in web browser within 10 seconds
And I click element $addOrderModal_addButton in web browser within 10 seconds
Once I do not see element $addOrderModal_addButton in web browser
		
Then I see $order_number in web browser within 10 seconds
And I see $customer_name in web browser within 10 seconds
And I see $price in web browser within 10 seconds
